This is a very simple Vim Script that allows you to post to Twitter straight from Vim.

Usage: Do the command :PosttoTwitter it will ask you for your Twitter in the command-line, type it in and hit enter to send it off. Or in a buffer; type the text you want to Twitter and in normal mode do :BPosttoTwitter to try and send the whole buffer, or :CPosttoTwitter to send the current line, or T to send the visualized text.
